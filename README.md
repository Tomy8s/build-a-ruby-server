# build-a-ruby-server

Welcome to this tutorial on how to build a webserver on Ruby.

## Step one

First you need to create a directory for you project. Lets call it `my-ruby-server`. Run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir my-ruby-server
```

And lets move into it to do all our work there:

```shell
cd my-ruby-server
```

Before you can start building a web server, you're going to install a ruby "gem" - some rub code written by other developers. The gem you need is called `sinatra`. Install it now by running:

```shell
gem install sinatra
```
